## Software Development
* Text
	> I have worked as a full-stack developer in an independent federal agency for the last 3 years, and my passion for developing continues to grow!

* Experience with each one

## Gaming

* Backlog
	> I keep a constantly updated record of what games I have ever played, beaten or completed. Check it out!

* Speedrunning
	> The act of speedrunning consists of beating a game as fast as possible considering a set of rules.  
	Since 2015, I have amassed a collection of speedruns, of which I am very proud!

* Jewels of the Past (JÃ³ias do Passado)
	> In Jewels of the Past, we play some old videogames I missed back then, analyse them with our modern knowledge and write small reviews aboout each of them.

* Fan projects: My favorite fan-made projects
	> What's not to love about a well-made fan game? They're expansions upon established franchises or characters, and representations of what fans want, regardless of the original game developers doing a good job or not.  
	Here is a list of fan projects curated by me. It includes only the ones I consider worthwhile to check out.
